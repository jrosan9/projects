        I'm a bit of a adrenaline junkie and I like to do spontaneous things.
        I've always wanted to go skiing and this year I had the opportunity to
        do so. Definitely recommend going to catskills area in upstate New York.
        Bellearye, Windham, and Hunter Mountain ski resort reside within an
        approximate 10-20 mile distance of each other. Will be going again next
        year.

        I think fitness is really important and contributes to your overall
        health; and balances whatever diet you consume. I eat a vegan diet and
        stay active to the best of my ability. Whilst being out in nature, I
        have a tendency to capture anything that is subjectively beautiful.
